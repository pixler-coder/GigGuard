Problem Statement: AI-Powered Insurance for India’s
Gig Economy
The Problem We're Solving:
India’s platform-based delivery partners (Zomato, Swiggy, Zepto, Amazon, Dunzo etc.)
are the backbone of our fast-paced digital economy. However, external disruptions such
as extreme weather, pollution, and natural disasters can reduce their working hours and
cause them to lose 20–30% of their monthly earnings. Currently, gig workers have no
income protection against these uncontrollable events. When disruptions occur, they
bear the full financial loss with no safety net.

The Challenge:
Build an AI-enabled parametric insurance platform that safeguards gig workers
against income loss caused by external disruptions such as extreme weather or
environmental conditions. The solution should provide automated coverage and
payouts, incorporate intelligent fraud detection mechanisms, and operate on a simple
weekly pricing model aligned with the typical earnings cycle of gig workers.

Critical Constraints:
You must strictly exclude coverage for health, life, accidents, or vehicle repairs.
Your financial model must be structured on a Weekly pricing basis to match the
typical payout cycle of a gig worker.
Core Disruptions to Address (Indicative Examples for Your
Persona)
IMPORTANT NOTE ON DISRUPTIONS: The disruptions mentioned below are
indicative examples of external factors causing income loss. Teams MUST use their
own ideation to identify the most relevant external disruption parameters for their
chosen delivery segment.
Disruption Type Examples (Adapt for
YOUR Persona)
Impact (Loss of Income)
Environmental Extreme heat, Heavy
rain, Floods, Severe
Pollution
Cannot work outdoors /
Deliveries halted
Social Unplanned curfews,
local strikes, sudden
market/zone closures
Inability to access
pickup/drop locations
Note: You are insuring the INCOME lost during these events, not the cost of fixing
external issues (e.g., no vehicle repair payouts).

Technical Requirements
Must-Have Features (Indicative Guidelines)
IMPORTANT NOTE: Evaluate what genuinely helps YOUR consumers.
● AI-Powered Risk Assessment
○ Dynamic premium calculation (Must be structured as a Weekly pricing
model)
○ Predictive risk modeling specific to the persona
● Intelligent Fraud Detection
○ Anomaly detection in claims
○ Location and activity validation
○ Duplicate claim prevention
● Parametric Automation
○ Real-time trigger monitoring
○ Automatic claim initiation for identified disruptions
○ Instant payout processing for lost income
● Integration Capabilities
○ Weather APIs (can use free tiers or mocks)
○ Traffic data (mocks acceptable)
○ Platform APIs (simulated is acceptable)
○ Payment systems (mock/sandbox/trial versions acceptable)
Note: These are the must have features. But the teams are free to ideate, innovate and
bring in other perspectives on top.

Deliverable Expectations
Your solution should demonstrate at least the below:
● Optimized onboarding for your delivery persona.
● Risk profiling using relevant AI/ML.
● Policy creation with appropriate pricing structured on a Weekly basis.
● Claim triggering through relevant parametric events (Loss of income triggers
only).
● Payout processing via appropriate channels.
● Analytics dashboard showing relevant metrics.

6-Week Journey & Problem Breakdown
Over the next 6 weeks, you will build an AI-powered, parametric insurance platform
designed exclusively for platform-based Delivery Partners. Your mission is to protect
their livelihoods from uncontrollable external disruptions (weather, app crashes,
curfews) that cause immediate loss of daily wages.
THE GOLDEN RULES (Read Before Starting)

Persona Focus: You must choose only delivery partners sub-category: Food
(Zomato/Swiggy), E-commerce (Amazon/Flipkart), or Grocery/Q-Commerce
(Zepto/Blinkit) and so on.
Coverage Scope: LOSS OF INCOME ONLY. You are building a safety net for
lost hours/wages. You must strictly exclude features for vehicle repairs, health
insurance, or accident medical bills.
Weekly Pricing: Gig workers operate week-to-week. Your financial/premium
model must be structured on a Weekly basis.
Timeline Overview
Phase 1 [March 4 - 20]: Ideation & Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Theme: "Ideate & Know Your Delivery Worker" This phase is dedicated to research,
ideation, planning, and building the foundational elements of your solution.
Submission Deadline for Phase 1 Deliverables: March 20, End of Day.
Deliverables:

1. The Idea Document
● A concise readme document in your Github Repository outlining your core
strategy covering the below:
○ Detail out the requirement with persona based scenarios and the workflow
for your application.
○ Explain how your Weekly premium model works, define your parametric
triggers, and justify your choice between a Web or Mobile platform.
○ Detail your plans of integrating AI/ML into the workflow (Premium
calculation, Fraud Detection and so on).
○ Outline your tech stack and development plan.
○ Anything else that you think is relevant.
● A link to your Git repository (GitHub/GitLab) consisting of the Readme.md file.
The same repo to be used for the subsequent phases.
● A 2-minute video uploaded to a publicly accessible link., outlining your strategy,
plan of execution and your prototype with minimal scope defined for this phase.

Phase 2 [March 21 - April 4]: Automation & Protection (Weeks 3-4)
Theme: "Protect Your Worker"
Deliverables:
● A 2-minute demo video uploaded to a publicly accessible link.
● Executable source code and solution submitted should showcase the below:
○ Registration Process
○ Insurance Policy Management
○ Dynamic Premium Calculation
○ Claims Management
Tips:
● AI Integration Example: Dynamic Pricing Models. Use Machine Learning to
adjust the Weekly premium based on hyper-local risk factors (e.g., the model
charges ₹2 less per week if the worker operates in a zone historically safe from
water logging, or dynamically offers increased coverage hours based on
predictive weather modelling).
● Build 3-5 automated triggers using public/mock APIs to identify the disruptions
leading to loss of income.
● A seamless, zero-touch claim process. What would be the best User Experience
for your customers?

Phase 3 [April 5 - 17]: Scale & Optimise (Weeks 5-6)
Theme: "Perfect for Your Worker"
Deliverables:
● Advanced Fraud Detection : Catch delivery-specific fraud (e.g., GPS spoofing,
fake weather claims using historical data).
● Instant Payout System (Simulated): Integrate mock payment gateways
(Razorpay test mode, Stripe sandbox, or UPI simulators) to demonstrate how the
worker receives their lost wages instantly.
● Intelligent Dashboard.
○ For Workers: Earnings protected, active weekly coverage.
○ For Insurers (Admin): Loss ratios, predictive analytics on next week's likely
weather/disruption claims.
● The Final Submission Package. Consolidate your 6 weeks of development into
the final artefacts required for Week 6 judging. You must upload:
○ A 5-minute demo video: A screen-capture walkthrough video of your
platform in action uploaded to a publicly accessible link. You must visually
demonstrate a simulated external disruption (e.g., triggering a fake
rainstorm) and show the automated AI claim approval and payout process.
○ Final Pitch Deck: Your presentation slides (PDF) covering your specific
delivery persona, your AI & fraud architecture, and the business viability of
your Weekly pricing model.
