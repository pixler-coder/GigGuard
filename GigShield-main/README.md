# 🛡️ GudieWire / GigGuard 

Welcome to the GigGuard monorepo! GigGuard is a parametric insurance engine designed specifically for gig workers in India, providing dynamic, weather-based coverage and automated payouts.

This repository holds the entire platform logic, from the sophisticated Machine Learning pricing backend to the beautifully animated React Native mobile app.

##  Quick Start (Running Locally)

**For Judges:  Instant Live Testing**
We have provided a direct, pre-built Android APK link so you can test the application live on your phone without installing any SDKs or development environments:
👉 **[Download the GigGuard Android APK Here](https://expo.dev/accounts/geek_aditya/projects/gigguard/builds/570f8f61-e74e-42b4-81a1-1d3075780bf0)**

Alternatively, if you wish to run the code manually, the Mobile App is pre-configured to connect to our live production AI model and database hosted on Render (`https://gigshield-4u5z.onrender.com`). **You only need to run the Mobile App locally to fully test the platform.** We have provided the backend code for full transparency.

### 1. The React Native Mobile App (Required)
```bash
cd MobileApp
npm install
npx expo start --clear
```
*Use the Expo Go app on your physical device, or press `i` to run in the iOS Simulator.*

### 2. The FastAPI Backend (Optional)
If you want to run the ML engine and API locally to verify our code, you will need to set up the environment variables.

Copy the provided example environment file (which includes our hackathon sandbox MongoDB access so your test will work out of the box):
```bash
cd ML_Engine/GigShield_v2_copy
cp .env.example .env
```

Then boot the AI engine:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
*The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000` via Uvicorn. To connect the mobile app to your local backend, change `BASE_URL` in `MobileApp/src/services/api.ts` to your local machine IP.*

##  Hackathon Specific Deliverables

If you are a judge reviewing our submission, please note the following technical constraints we specifically engineered:
1. **Underwriting (Active Days check)**: Evaluated directly in `main.py` dynamically shutting down Premium tiers if users have `< 5` active days.
2. **Delhi NCR AQI Trigger**: A highly specific geo-fenced trigger mapping stagnation and solar blockage in `disruption_triggers.py` to trigger severe pollution warnings for riders.
3. **Catastrophic Event Circuit Breakers**: If the dynamic AI loss-ratio hits >85%, the backend safely intercepts the UI and triggers an immediate suspension lock.
4. **API Rate-Limit Fallback**: Hackathons often face unstable Wi-Fi and severe third-party API rate limits during live judging (like Open-Meteo free tier). We engineered a **Hard Failover Strategy** into our FastAPI backend. If the live weather API drops or hits its limit, our Python script automatically intercepts the `httpx.RequestError` and falls back to injecting realistic, hardcoded mock meteorological data. This guarantees you will experience a flawless, crash-free UI demo!
5. **Unified Trust Score & 7-Layer Fraud Firewall**: Every rider carries a persistent `trust_score` (0–100) in MongoDB that evolves based on behavior. Honest riders earn trust (+3 per clean payout) → shorter vesting periods (2h) and instant settlements. Suspicious accounts get longer vesting (24h) and hard blocks. The fraud engine runs 7 layers per payout scan: Haversine Geofence (40km), OSRM Kinematic Speed Check, IP Datacenter Detection (ip-api.com), 3D Topographical Altitude Trap (Open-Meteo), Temporal Ping Consistency (Coefficient of Variation), Behavioral Claim Ratio Analysis, and an API Fail-Safe "Fog of War" penalty. All layers contribute to a composite `FraudVerdict` score — no single anomaly causes a false ban.
6. **Flash Crash Circuit Breaker**: A global sliding-window velocity limiter (`deque`) tracks aggregate payouts. If the system attempts to disburse more than ₹50,000 in any 5-minute window, a `GLOBAL_PAYOUT_FREEZE` halts all automated settlements to prevent coordinated drain attacks.
7. **Razorpay Payment Integration**: Full Razorpay Sandbox integration for premium collection with order creation, signature verification, and a hosted checkout page. Payouts are simulated via RazorpayX with mock UTR generation for 10-second auto-settlement demonstrations.
8. **Admin Analytics Dashboard**: A complete web-based admin panel (`/admin/*` endpoints) providing real-time platform metrics — total users, active policies, loss ratios, trust distribution, trigger frequency analysis, daily payout/premium charts, and circuit breaker monitoring.
9. **Memory-Optimized Deployment**: The ML engine loads the XGBoost model in native binary format (`.ubj`) via `xgb.Booster`, eliminating the `scikit-learn` runtime dependency entirely and saving ~100MB RAM — critical for running on Render's 512MB free tier.
10. **Judge ML Sandbox**: A dedicated interactive simulator panel inside the mobile dashboard (activated via the 🧠 icon) allowing hackathon judges to override live weather parameters (rain, temperature, wind speed) and bypass Open-Meteo. This lets you see the custom XGBoost model and Disruption Trigger engine dynamically recalculate the Risk Gauge, Loss Ratios, and pricing in real-time, finishing with a "Force Autopay" option to visually simulate the 8-step fraud firewall pipeline.
